#tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) is a command-line tool that lets you run and manage multiple terminal 
#sessions inside a single window â€” and even keep them running after you disconnect.


# ls -la            for your latest runned commands
# CTRL A+D          to detach from tmux

# tmux starts a new session.
# tmux new -s NAME starts it with that name.
# tmux ls lists the current sessions
# Within tmux typing CTRL+A d detaches the current session
# tmux a attaches the last session. You can use -t flag to specify which


# Windows - Equivalent to tabs in editors or browsers, they are visually separate parts of the same session
# CTRL+A c Creates a new window. To close it you can just terminate the shells doing <C-d>
# CTRL+A N Go to the N th window. Note they are numbered
# CTRL+A p Goes to the previous window
# CTRL+A n Goes to the next window
# CTRL+A , Rename the current window
# CTRL+A w List current windows



# Panes - Like vim splits, panes let you have multiple shells in the same visual display.
# <C-b> " Split the current pane horizontally
# <C-b> % Split the current pane vertically
# <C-b> <direction> Move to the pane in the specified direction. Direction here means arrow keys.
# <C-b> z Toggle zoom for the current pane
# <C-b> [ Start scrollback. You can then press <space> to start a selection and <enter> to copy that selection.
# <C-b> <space> Cycle through pane arrangements.
